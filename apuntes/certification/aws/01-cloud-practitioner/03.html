<h1>AWS Cloud Practitioner / Architecture Design Principles</h1>

<ul>
<li>First root account and Identity Access Management - IAM</li>
<li>Virtual Private Clouds - VPCs</li>
<li>Amazon Machine Images - AMIs</li>
</ul>

<p>
A <b>Hypervisor</b> is the software that produces and manages virtual infrastructure
, allowing multiple operating systems to run and share resources on a single physical machine
</p>

<p>
Sharing CPU cycles, RAM memory and storage.
</p>

<p>
The system running the hypervisor is called <b>the host</b>
</p>

<p>
It is commonly a rack mounted server blade.
</p>

<p>
The virtual machines running on the host are <b>the guest</b>
</p>

<p>
Each VM takes one set of physical hw
</p>

<p>
Multi-tenancy of guests usually involves OS like windows, linux, BSD, etc
</p>

<h2>Types of Hypervisors</h2>

<h3>Type 1 (native or bare metal)</h3>

<table class="border c">
<tr>
	<td>HW</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Hypervisor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Guest OS(s)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>App(s)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Some implementations are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>KVM</li>
<li>Xen from Citrix</li>
<li>Hyper-V from Microsoft</li>
<li>vSphere/ESXi</li>
<li>OVM</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>AWS runs on Xen type 1 hypervisors</b>
</p>

<h3>Type 2 hypervisor</h3>

<table class="border c">
<tr>
	<td>HW</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Host OS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Apps, one is a Type2 Hypervisor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Guest OS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>App(s)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Some implementations are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle Virtual Box</li>
<li>VMware Workstation / VMWare player / Fusion</li>
<li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization</li>
<li>qemu</li>
</ul>

<h2>AWS shared responsability model</h2>

<p>
AWS manages physical security and hypervisor security, it ensures guests OS
run securely isoletad from one another.
</p>

<p>
The consumer takes responsability for managing the guest operating system
(including updates and security patches), related application security, the design
of the virtual networks and logical firewall.
</p>

<h3>Risk treatment</h3>

<p>
Reduction or Acceptance
</p>

<p>
How much do you decide to manage or use managed services?
</p>

<p>
How much is on-premises and how much is on cloud?
</p>

<p>
Shared responsability is a form of risk transference
</p>

<p>
When you migrate resources to a cloud services provider (CSP), the service level agreement (SLA)
becomes a joint shared responsability between the provider and the consumer
</p>

<p>
<b>IasS</b> and <b>SaaS</b> have clear demarcation points
</p>

<p>
<b>PaaS</b> demarcation is less clear, and depend on how managed service means.
</p>

<h2>AWS provider responsability</h2>

<p>
AWS responsabilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS datacenters are <b>nondescript</b> undisclosed locations with 24/7 staff</li>
<li>MFA for facility entry with continuous monitoring, logging and auditing</li>
<li>Automated changes and control processes</li>
<li>Bastion services act as gateways for privileged access</li>
<li>Network boundary devices monitor and audit access with intrusion detection and analysis</li>
</ul>

<figure>
	<img src="img/aws-resp-iaas.png" style="width: 100%">
	<figcaption>In <b>IaaS</b> AWS responsability lies in the gray area in the image</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Customers responsabilities:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Content stored on AWS</li>
<li>AWS services used with the content</li>
<li>The country where content is stored</li>
<li>The format and structure</li>
<li>Access to that content</li>
</ul>

<p>
The particular services determines the customer-side responsabilities.
</p>

<p>
For example with EC2 instances you would be responsible for updates and upgrades and security patching.
</p>

<p>
The <b>customer</b> is <b>ultimately responsible</b> for compliance, regulations and adhering to
attestation and auditing by third parties.
</p>

<h2>Root account</h2>

<ul>
<li>You should never programmatically access resources using the resource account</li>
<li>If you must, keep it secure, rotate it regularly</li>
<li>To delete or rotate your AWS account access keys go to</li>
<br>Security Credentials page in AWS Management Console</li>
<li>Setup a Multi factor authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the root account can do:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the root user details and password</li>
<li>Change support plan, payment options and billing</li>
<li>Close the account or sign up for GovCloud</li>
<li>Create an X.509v3 signing certificate</li>
<li>Transfer Route 53 domain to another account</li>
</ul>

	</ul>
<li>VPC</li>
</ul>

<h2>VPC (virtual private cloud)</h2>

<p>
On VPC Dashboard
</p>

<p>
There are several network resources
</p>

<p>
There is a default VPC, it uses a 16bit mask, you can have several subnets
</p>

<p>
You can have many VPCs on your account, Custom VPC is labeled as <b>Non-default VPC</b>
</p>

<p>
Example: having 3 subnets in your VPC, you can put each one in an
availability zone having high availability.
</p>

<p>
VPC wizard is infrastructure as code: You can use CloudFormation
</p>

<p>
Ways to configure a VPC:
</p>

</li>

<li><figure>
	<figcaption>VPC with a private subnet only and hardware VPN access</figcaption>
	<img src="img/vpc-config-4.png">
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Networking details</h3>

<p>
AWS creates a default VPC
</p>

<p>
For each VPC it creates 3 subnets
</p>

<p>
You can view the route table for each subnet
</p>

<p>
If a subnet has configured a <b>IGW</b> (Internet Gateway) it is considered public
</p>

<p>
If I remove the IGW it becomes a private subnet
</p>

<p>
I can add a <b>VPG</b> (Virtual Private Gateway) to connect to a VPN
</p>

<p>
An Instance can be asigned a public IP address from the IP pool or an Elastic IP address
</p>

<p>
An Elastic IP address is also taken from the pool, but the beauty is asigned to your account, and
you can reallocate to other EC2 instance. If you have a Elastic IP and is not assigned, you will
be charged.
</p>

<p>
To being able to communicate a instance that is only on private subnet, you have to add a NAT
gateway, the NAT gateway sits in the public subnet.
</p>

<p>
By the way, a NAT gw has to use an Elastic IP address. NAT is used <i>only for IPv4</i>.
<br>For IPv6 you need to use an <b>Egress Only Internet Gateway</b> <i>only for IPv6</i>.
</p>

<p>
DHCP options can be used if you want to modify the default DHCP server.
</p>

<h4>Network Endpoints</h4>

<p>
Endpoints allows you to setup communication between services in the AWS cloud, there are 2 types:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Gateway endpoint</b>: It is configured in the subnet route table. For example connect your instances
to a DB or S3 service.</li>

<li><b>Interface endpoint</b>: Does not involve anything in the route table. For example if I want to not use
a volume to store my files, and use Elastic File System (cool service that allows to shrink
and grow storage), you have to configure an <b>Endpoint</b> and it is going to be a logical network
interface, and use one IP address.

<p>
The Interface endpoint will use one of the IP adress in your subnet, while the gateway endpoint
is just an entry in the route table.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If you want to connect two VPCs you will do that through <b>Peering Connections</b> it can be done
even between different root accounts, one is the requester and the other is the accepter.
<br>The IP address can not overlap
<br>They are not transitive, that means you have to explicitly create a peer for each pair of VPCs
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>AMI :: Amazon Machine Image</h2>

<p>
<b>EC2</b> - Elastic Cloud Compute
</p>

<p>
EC2 instance is a provisioned virtual machine, to provision a virtual machine you start from
a software stack image or AMI.
</p>

<p>
There is a AMI marketplace with more than 500 images of different OSs and software stacks.
</p>

<p>
You can build your own AMI with the <b>EC2 Image Builder</b>, also it can build docker Images.
</p>

<p>
AMI is a software template which includes OS and optionaly applications.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of Linux distributions for everyone like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon linux</li>
<li>Cent OS</li>
<li>Debian</li>
<li>Fedora</li>
<li>Gentoo</li>
<li>openSUSE</li>
<li>Red Hat</li>
<li>SUSE</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>MacOS</li>
</ul>

<p>
For several architectures:
</p>

<ul>
<li>32-bits x86</li>
<li>64-bits x86</li>
<li>64-bits Arm</li>
</ul>

<p>
The AMI will include the root volume of that particular OS
</p>

<p>
In IaaS you will be responsible of licence and software that is installed within the Instance
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>EBS</b> :: Elastic Block Storage</li>
<li>Instance Store</li>
</ul>

<p>
Will be covered later.
</p>

<h2>Secure connectivity options</h2>

<p>
There are several options to connect to the resources in a VPC that is not public:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Virtual private gateway</b> (VPG) for this option, first you create a Customer Gateway,
that is the device at your headquarters (physical or virtual) that you will use to connect.
That device has to know routes to resources in your VPC subnets.
<br>There is Static or Dynamic routing protocol options, with Dynamic you have to assign
the BGP (border gateway protocol) ASN (autonomous system number). 64512-65534 (are for
private use)
<br>You have to configure the public IP address or have a Certificate (Certificate ARN).
<br>You could go to <i>Certificate Services</i> in AWS and generate an X.509v3 cert for that
device and simple choose it.
<br><br>Having the Custom Gateway created, you create the VPG, an this will go to the route table
in the VPC.
</li>

<li>
<b>Site-to-Site VPN Connections</b> after you have created the Customer Gateway and the VPG, you
go to this menu, and configure both.
<br>This will create 2 tunnels for us so we have a failover.
<br>AWS can assign the IPv4 address (from APIPA 169.254.*.*)
<br>Even can create a pre-shared key
<br>Many params of IPSec can be configured
<br>AKA in the past as <u>Managed VPN</u>
</li>

<li>
<b>Client VPN Endpoint</b>, this is a client to site VPN, you install open VPN in the client
(your mobile, laptop, workstation).
<br>AKA in the past as <u>Peer to site VPN</u>
</li>
</ul>
