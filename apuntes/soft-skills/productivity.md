# How to improve productivity

## The productity equation

PRODUCTIVITY = USEFUL OUTPUT / TIME LAPSE x FUN FACTOR

## A model to think about what we are doing

<b>Pilot</b> 10% of the time, when we set the course, and check
continually that the plane keeps on route.

<b>Plane</b> 80% of the time, when we are doing the activities.

<b>Engineer</b> 5-10% of the time, is when we organize our time,
and check efficiency metrics, and provide correction actions.

Look other way, we have a 20% of overhead.

## The myth of I dont have time

Every one have the same amount of time, is the more egalitarian distributed resource
we humans have.

> Time is what we have most, but what we use the worse.<br>Alfonso Baqueiro Bernal (2022)

Instead of saying I did not make A because I did not have time, tell:
<br>I did not allocate anytime to make A.

We choose to allocate time for the things we consider more important.

## The myth of motivation

We are not 3 year old childs, so we don't need the motivation to start doing
something, we should have the <b>discipline</b> to make what it's needed even
when we don't feel the like to do it.

Use a penalty (money) for not getting the target done.

Search how to make more fun what you do.

## The myth of the myth of multitasking

Sometimes I think, what about if also the myth of multitasking is a myth either?

There is also the law of diminishing marginal returns over time, so
<b>What is the optimal time slice for switching tasks?</b>

There is also this known as <b>flow state</b> when you are in this state is
better to just commit to only that task, loosing that state is not good for
productivity.

Dot not allow distractions when in flow state.

## The 3 zones

1. The comfort zone
2. The stretch zone
3. The panic zone

If we stay in comfort zone, we will not have any progress, but also if we find
really difficult something we get into panic.

So we need to try to stay in the stretch zone, where we find things not too
easy and boring but not to hard to trigger our fight or fly response. Be in the
right difficult level.Â 

We need to concentrate our efforts in the <b>stretch zone</b> other case we are
loosing time in the comfort zone, or get stuck in the panic zone.

## The 3 laws of productivity

### Parkinson's Law

> Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it.<br>Cyril Parkinson (1950s)

Having to much time to do somethin is a recipi for procastination.

Having short deadlines forces us to prioritize in the important and leave the minutia.

### Pareto's principle

80/20 rule

80 percent of the output comes from 20 percent of the input.

80 percent of the result comes from 20 percent of the effort.

Expected Value = Utility * Probability

Work evolving in spiral way.

### Newton's first law of motion

An object is at rest or travelling at a constant velocity unless it's acted on
by an external, imbalanced force (inertia law).

If we are still we need an external force to push us, but if we are moving, we
have an inertia that helps us moving.

Getting start is always hard.

If something takes less than 2 minutes doing do not waste 10 planning it, do it right now.

Trick your brain to just start an activity for just 5 minutes.

## 3 powers of productivity

### Power of consistency

<b>Consistency</b>: To get a massively gain you only need to make tiny efforts and habit.

<b>Identity</b>: Commit to be the kind of person you want.

Prevent <b>self savotage</b>: example, do not say to yourself I am not the kind of person who learns easy, I am not the kind of person that cooks, I am not the kind of person that goes to the gym.

### Power of productive downtime

Use downtimes to make productive things, if you have to wait 30 minutes the train, read a book or do something productive in that time.

Have a highlight for your day.

### Productive Procastination

When feel to procastinate, do doing productive distractions.

## What is the point of being productive?

Whats the point of life?

<b>happiness</b>: enjoy ourselves.

<b>meaning</b>: being useful to others.

Figure how to make things more fun.

Do not screw yourself.

Have to vs Get to (Seth Godin)

The environment is very important to get things done, you need an apropiate environment.

Happiness led to success.

We do have the choice, to enjoy what we do.
