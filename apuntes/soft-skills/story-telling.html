<h1>Story telling</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The fuel of fiction is conflict.
</p>

<p>
What is conflict?<br>
Someone wants or needs something, but someone or something stands in the way.<br>
Some are physical conflicts, while others are social or emotional.
</p>

<p>
Without an unresolved conflict fueling the experience,
the audience perceives they are no in an actual story.<br>
THey will very quickly lose patience and interest, and
then you will lose them.
</p>

<p>
Conflict is also the fuel of gameplay.<br>
A challenge with goals and obstacles is placed before the player.<br>
A game with no challennges, goals or obtacles can hardly be called a game,
any more than a story without conflict can be called a story.
</p>

<p>
It is compelling to watch someone try to resolve conflicts (as in books, TV,
movies, etc) and it is potentially even more compelling to feel like you
really are that conflict-resolving character (as in games).
</p>

<p>
Without a want/but, there is no conflict. Without a conflict,
there are no obstacles. Without obstacle, there is neither a
story nor a game.<br>
Conflicts is essential to both.
</p>

<p>
For better or worse, we as humans are better able to
emotionally relate to a single person than to a thousand or a
mllion. Seein a single person in pain will evoke a stronger
emotional response than watching a planet full of people explode.
</p>

<p>
So remember-always have conflict. And only make the scope of the
conflict as large as it needs to be, no larger.
</p>

<blockquote>Story is conflict</blockquote>

<h2>Story Structure</h2>

<p>
The 3 Act Structure: it is used in plays, movies, books, and games.
</p>

<p>
Ways back in 335 BC by Aristotle in his Poetics: "A whole is what has a
beginning and middle and end".
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Beginning</b> setup the conflict, the "once upon a time".</li>
<li><b>Middle</b> confrontation</li>
<li><b>End</b> resolution of the conflict, the "and they lived happy ever after".</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Act 1. Beginning</h3>

<p>
Why it is needed?<br>
In order to understand any change, we need to have a clear picture of the before
as well as the after, a great example, weight-loss ads.
</p>

<p>
The hero often is in charge of improve himself and those around him.<br>
Why will he care enough to try?<br>
Most of the times because he is the the good one<br>
or his env is bad enough that requires struggle to improve it.
</p>

<p>
There is an incident that introduces the hero to the main conflict.
</p>

<h3>Act 2. Middle confrontation</h3>

<p>
It's time to start seeing what kinds of obstacles the protagonist
will confront and how he'll manage to overcome them.
</p>

<p>
Main conflict normally takes the form of a villain, the antagonist
supported by its minions.
</p>

<p>
This part is bigger thant the others, about twice, sometimes it gets
hard to handle its structure, planning and pacing. Author can lose
momentum easily.<br>
Gurus split it in 2 halves, separated by a midpoint (of the act and the
story) at which things spin in a new direction.
</p>

<p>
Act 2 sees progressively increasing tension, drama and stakes
(rising action) and culminates with Hero finally understanding and seeing
the path to resolving the conflict.
</p>

<h3>Act 3. End/Resolution</h3>

<p>
This is the big finale, what the audience has been itching to
experience ever since the conflict was first introduced to find out
"what happens".
</p>

<p>
The Hero makes his ultimate effort to resolve the conflict and either
succeeds (happy ending) or fails (sad ending).
</p>

<p>
<b>Sad or down</b> endings in mainstream are rare because they break
expectations and can leave audience members feeling disappointed, agry
or even depressed.
</p>

<p>
Even when the protagonist is not hero but villain, the happy ends
means he gets away with it, for example the netflix serie <b>You</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Happy or up</b> endings tend to evoke a positive reaction, but
only if you give the audience what they wanted, <b>but not the way
they expected it.</b>
</p>

<p>
Once conflict is resolved, the story needs to end before things grind
to a complete halt and audience gets bored.
</p>

<h3>Transitions</h3>

<p>
We often don't experience any kind of puase or indication we are
transitioning from act to act. Even in novels, chapters not indicate
a act transition.
</p>

<p>
<img src="story-telling/01-plot-points.png"><br>
The two breaks between three acts are colled <b>Plot Points</b>
</p>

<p>
In plot point 2, the protagonist has had some kind of <b>epiphany</b> and
at last knows what he needs to do.
</p>

<h3>Tension map</h3>

<p>
The level of tension as felt by the audience is a good metric
of conflict and pacing, can be counted on to predict how engaging
the story is likely to be to the audience at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
<img src="story-telling/02-tension-graph.png"><br>
Look at how tension levels generally looks like.
</p>

<p>
Each spike in Act 2 is a crisis, and the biggest crisis of all is the
<b>climax</b> (in Act 3).
</p>

<p>
Each spike starts by setting up a <b>sub-conflict</b>, which causes
tension to escalet as the Hero tries to overcome it, and concludes
wtih a tension relaxation once the sub-conflict is resolved.
</p>

<h3>Structure applied</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Act 1</b><br>
we meet our hero, eking out a livable but humdrum existence
</li>
<li>
<b>Inciting incident</b><br>
Hero becomes aware of the main conflict, or its implied existenc
</li>
<li>
<b>Plot Point 1</b><br>
Hero commits to resolving the main conflic.
</li>
<li>
<b>Act 2</b><br>
Hero overcomes increasingly challenging obstacles in his quest
to resolve the conflict.
</li>
<li>
<b>Plot Point 2</b><br>
Hero has <i>epiphany</i>, sees the path to success.
</li>
<li>
<b>Act 3</b><br>
Hero resolves the conflict; rewards and punsihments are doled out.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some examples:
<ul>
<li>1965 - Dune (novel)</li>
<li>1977 - Star wars</li>
<li>1984 - Dune</li>
<li>1997 - Titanic</li>
<li>1999 - Matrix</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<img src="story-telling/03-tension-in-games.png"><br>
Tension in video games graph.
</p>

<p>
While traditional story audiences (novels, movies, comics, books
and plays) come into the experience with a certain degree of
patience, they tolerate a 25% or more of initial setup.<br>
Video game players expect to play within seconds, or at most
after a minute or two, that means overcoming obstacles  related
to the conflict.
</p>

<p>
First gameplay minutes need to be very compelling indeed,
to convince players they want to stay awhile.
</p>

<p>
Game designers jump straight to the introduction of the main
conflict. So Act 1 is only a few seconds or absent.<br>
examples:
<ul>
<li>BioShock</li>
<li>Far Cry 3</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto III</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The counter example: Valve's <b>Half-Life</b><br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHeTpqOeJBc">Half-Life Walkthroug</a><br>
It is a sample that some g amers are willing and able to handle a low
or no-confilct beginning.
